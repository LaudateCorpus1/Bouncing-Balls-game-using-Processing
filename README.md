# Bouncing-Balls-game-using-Processing
This game is done through processing and java technology.  Make this game as simple as it looks. Have the sky appear as a gradient of blue shades, each 50 pixels high. The shades get darker towards the top of the screen. Also, if the Man misses any of the balls, they will land in the mud and the game is over. This is shown in the demo video as the whole screen going red. So puddings can now only bounce off man's hat and it is the man's job to keep them bouncing along. there must be 5 balls thrown at once, each at a slightly different angle. Consult the demonstration for details but precisely: The initial x-velocity of each pudding must be a random number between 1.15 and 1.2 The initial y-velocity of each pudding must be a random number between 0.2 and 1.2 The balls must appear from the top left corner and are subject to gravity. As well, there is a basket on the right hand edge of the screen. If the man bounces a ball into the basket, he can keep it. The ball can bounce off the side of the screen as well, including into the basket. Keep a count of how much money Man has made in the top right of the screen. Every time a ball goes into the basket, the man pockets $6 and another ball is thrown from the top-left corner. Use PVectors to store the position and velocity of each pudding.
